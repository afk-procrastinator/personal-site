# My Personal Website

This was a little afternoon project I thought up to learn more about Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. I also wanted to play around with some new tools I've been interested in — Mapbox, Cursor, and deck.gl. It uses the lovely [Catppuccin Mocha](https://catppuccin.com/) color palette (like most of my projects).
