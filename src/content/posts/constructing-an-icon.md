# Constructing an Icon: The History and Significance of the Constructivist Experiment of Dom Narkomfin

*Presented at the REEESÂ© 2024 Student Conference*

In this paper, I examine the history and significance of Dom Narkomfin, the iconic constructivist apartment building in Moscow, arguing that it serves as an excellent foil for understanding the Russian government and public's evolving views on avant-garde architecture and housing. I trace the building's journey from its idealistic origins as a transitional social condenser in the 1920s, through its neglect during the Stalinist era, renewed interest during the Khrushchev Thaw, and near collapse in the post-Soviet period, to its recent restoration and reemergence as a unique residential space valued for its history and design. I contend that Dom Narkomfin's enduring power and legacy derive from its ability to represent the paradoxes inherent in Russian culture and history, as well as its capacity to foster a strong sense of community among its residents, transcending the specific intentions of its architect, Moisei Ginzburg.
