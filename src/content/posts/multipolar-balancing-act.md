# A Multipolar Balancing Act

*Independent Research Project*

This research paper compares the most recent versions of the United States' National Security Strategy (NSS) and the European Union's Strategic Compass (ESC) to better understand each actor's current stance towards China, arguing that while both documents prioritize the challenges posed by China's rise, they differ in their approaches. The NSS clearly elevates China over Russia as the primary long-term threat to the international order, advocating for a multilateral approach to address expanding Chinese influence, while the ESC, despite its goal of fostering European strategic autonomy, remains cautious in its rhetoric and actions towards China due to the EU's economic ties and internal divisions. The paper concludes that the EU finds itself at an inflection point, attempting to balance its priorities and reach a consensus on strategic autonomy, as it navigates an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape shaped by the intensifying US-China rivalry and the ongoing war in Ukraine.
