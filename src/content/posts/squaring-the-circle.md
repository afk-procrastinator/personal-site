# Squaring the Circle: Of Artificial Automata and Intelligence

*Senior Honors Thesis*

In my senior thesis, I examine the challenges of aligning artificial intelligence with human values through the lens of Thomas Hobbes' political philosophy. I draw parallels between the "artificial personhood" Hobbes describes in the state and modern corporations, and the agency we increasingly attribute to AI, especially in light of recent advancements in large language models. I argue that AI represents a "Second Singularity" as transformative as the rise of modern states and corporations, necessitating a reexamination of how we attribute responsibility to artificial entities and regulate their development to ensure alignment with human interests.
